Welcome, IBM. Seriously (from Apple in 1981) 

Welcome to the most exciting and important marketplace since the computer revolution began 35 years ago.
 
And congratulations on your first personal computer.
 
Putting real computer power in the hands of the individual is already improving the way people work, think, learn, communicate, and spend their leisure hours.
 
Computer literacy is fast becoming as fundamental a skill as reading or writing.
 
When we invented the first personal computer system, we estimated that over 140,000,000 people worldwide could justify the purchase of one, if only they understood its benefits.
 
Next year alone, we project that well over 1,000,000 will come to that understanding. Over the next decade, the growth of the personal computer will continue in logarithmic leaps.
 
We look forward to responsible competition in the massive effort to distribute this American technology to the world.
 
And we appreciate the magnitude of your commitment.
 
Because what we are doing is increasing social capital by enhancing individual productivity.
 
Welcome to the task. .
